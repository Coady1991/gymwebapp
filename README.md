College Assignment, Web Development

A gym requires an app to periodically track assessments on individual members.
Assessments capture essential measurements on a the member at a given date.
The member inputs their assessment measurements and analytics are generated on the status
of the member after a given assessment, such as their BMI, BMI Cateogry, and if their are 
of an ideal weight. The app enables a trainer to review assessments, and comment on any specific assessment
or delete a member from the records.
